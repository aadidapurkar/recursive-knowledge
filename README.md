# Recursive Knowledge

1. Define an entire knowledge base as an n-ary tree/graph in `knowledge.ts` <br>
2. Display all that knowledge to the user <br>
3. When the user clicks a piece of knowledge they might be unsure about, or want to find out more: <br>
    Highlight prerequisite knowledge of that unsure knowledge

### Setup
- `npm i`
- `npm run dev` / `npm run build + npx serve`
